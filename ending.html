    		Back from their little walk outside, the Bear's came back to 
    		their house expecting three bowls of warm porridge waiting for 
    		them. However, when they walked into their kitchen, all three 
    		noticed something wrong with their porridge bowls: their spoons 
    		were already in their bowls! And they had not touched them at 
    		all! Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear let out upset cries.

    		The three bears then moved to the living area, where they found out
    		their chairs had been moved around the room from their original spots. 
    		The three bears let out more angry cries, for it was obvious someone had 
    		been scurrying around their house without their permission.

		<p class = "upset papa">"Someone has been sitting in my chair!"</p>
		<p class = "upset mama">"Someone has been sitting in my chair!"</p>
		<p class = "upset baby">"Someone has been sitting in my chair, and they broke it!!"</p>

		    Finally, the three bears moved anxiously upstairs to their bedroom, 
		    not knowing what to expect. Upon entering the bedroom, they looked 
		    around and realized the sheets on their beds had been pulled back. It 
		    looked as if someone had laid in their beds and left!
		</p>
		
		<p class = "upset papa">"Someone has been laying in my bed!"</p>
		<p class = "upset mama">"Someone has been laying in my bed!"</p>
		<p class = "upset baby">"Someone has been laying in my bed, and look, she's still here!!"</p>

    		Golilocks was awaken upon hearing Baby Bear's shrill cries. She rose
    		with a start, and looked around her. She was surrounded by three bears, all 
    		who looked very upset with her. She realized that this must be their house, 
    		and she had invaded their space without their permission! Oh no, she would 
    		be in so much trouble! But before she had a chance to say anything, Papa 
    		Bear rose his arms and let out a large roar. Golidlocks, frightened to 
    		the core by the roar, jumped from Baby Bear's bed and leaped out the open 
    		window in the bedroom. Once she landed outside, she ran as fast as she 
    		could, in hopes of finding her way out of the forest.

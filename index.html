    		Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in 
    		a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear,
    		and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear.
    		They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little 
    		Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a 
    		great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit
    		in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair
    		for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear.
    		And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee
    		Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great
    		bed for the Great Big Bear.

		    One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, 
		    and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into 
		    the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not 
		    burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, 
		    well-brought-up Bears. The door was not locked, because the
		    Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never 
		    suspected that anybody would harm them.

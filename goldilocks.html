    		Goldilocks was a little girl who was meandering through the 
    		forest as she was running an errand for her mother. However, while
    		she was traveling through the vast greenery, she found herself lost.
    		Which way was she to go again? She could not remember!
    		However, in her panic to find her way back home she suddenly found 
    		herself facing a small but cozy looking home. Curiousity taking over 
    		her, Goldilocks found herself walking up to the window and looking 
    		inside. She saw no one in the house, so she thought to herself, "Well, 
    		it wouldn't be so bad if I just had a little look around myself," 
    		because she was not a well-raised little girl. So, she turned the 
    		door handle and wandered on inside the bear's residence.

		<p>
		    Once inside, Goldilocks was greeted by three bowls of porridge 
		    sitting on the table in front of her. "How delicious!" she thought 
		    to herself, "porridge is my favorite!" She set about helping herself
		    to the bear's breakfast.

        	Goldilocks felt satisfied, having a full stomach and resting 
        	in a very comfortable chair. However, as she leaned back to stretch 
        	her arms, she heard something snap, and all of a sudden Goldilocks 
        	found herself on the ground surrounded by pieces of a now broken 
        	chair.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
        	<span class="upset">"Oh that does it!"</span> Goldilocks whined. 
        	<span class="upset">"Nothing's gonna stop me from getting the rest 
        	what I want! Not even a broken chair!"</span>
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
        	With a big huff, Goldilocks found herself in search of a new place 
        	of comfort: a nice, comfy bed. She climbed the stairs to the upper bedroom 
        	where she found herself faced with three different beds. "Ah, I'm super 
        	tired, I'm sure whoever lives here won't mind if I lie down real quick for 
        	a little nap.

    	<p>
    	    In fact, Baby Bear's bed was so comfortable that Goldilocks found 
    	    herself dozing off. Before she knew it, she was fast asleep.
